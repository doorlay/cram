# Cram

A command line text compressor and decompressor, using Huffman Nodes for lossless compression.

Basically, wrote a few additions to a class project for easy command line text compression.

# Syntax
-c indicates compression, -d indicates decompression.

- Compressing
In the command line, execute `python compress.py [filename.txt] -c`
The outputted file will be named "filename_compressed.txt".

- Decompressing
In the command line, execute `python compress.py [filename.txt] -d`
The outputted file will be named "filename_decompressed.txt".
